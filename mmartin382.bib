Starting with single configuration based theory going to MP, CI, QCI, CC, and ending with some not so well known techniques. Followed by the computational cost of each method as the theory gets built up. Tying it all together with multiconfiguration-based theories; expressing that this is the big problem when trying to model large systerm. Taking the same approch as to express the evolution of theory for multiconfiguration based methods. Concluding that small molecules are readly understood and well defined to model, while all methods need further work for larger molecules.},
